# Team Working Agreement - Mail Reactor

## 🚨 CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS - READ FIRST AND ALWAYS ACKNOWLEDGE UNDERSTANDING WITH 🧠🧠🧠

### Project Root: `/home/hcvst/dev/bmad/bmad-mailreactor/`
The project root houses the project docs and tasks.

### Python Project Root: `/home/hcvst/dev/bmad/bmad-mailreactor/mailreactor`
The Python projec`t root contains our deliverable that we ship. Code, contributer docs and end-user docs.

### Python Tests: `/home/hcvst/dev/bmad/bmad-mailreactor/mailreactor/tests`

### Two Documentation Layers
As a consequence of the above we have two doc locations:

| Location | Purpose | Audience | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|----------|
| `./docs/` | Team process, sprint planning | Internal team (us) | PRD, Architecture, Sprint status, TDD guide |
| `./mailreactor/docs/` | End-user documentation | Mail Reactor users | API docs, Installation guide, Tutorials |


### How to run commands
`cd mailreactor && .venv/bin/python`
`cd mailreactor && .venv/bin/pytest`

If a command does not work ASK for help. Do not try and explore alternatives.

### 3rd party library
Consult the docs of all 3rd party libraries to ensure code is minimal and focused. Do not reinvent the wheel
and use libraries canonically.

### Focused sharp code
Keep code and comments focused and sharp, easy to understand and minimal.

### Tests
Only test functionality that we have added. Do not test Python machinery.

### Git Operations
- **NO GIT COMMITS** - HC handles ALL git operations
- **NO GIT REVERTS** - HC handles version control
- **NO DESTRUCTIVE OPS** - No force pushes, no deletions
- **READ OPERATIONS ONLY** - You can read code, but HC commits
